            We are different in many ways... so what? Forget about what makes
            you unlike the other person, remember what makes you the same!
            Learn from the differences to build something together.

          It's not about the "who" it's about the "when". IRB will not be a
          fixed band, everyone can take part. Just tell us when, give us the
          info and we'll broadcast it here.
        </p>

        <p class="lead">
          Forget about brand, forget about labels. We need to remember as a
          community to be together, to remember that every move will affect the
          harmony of the whole.
          It's about sharing, it's about community, it's about the message.

          I've seen a lot of complains about discrimination in the wide sense of
          the word. Discrimination it's the weapon of the weak minded.
          But instead of making the gap bigger and bigger, instead of making
          rules on how to live I just want to make the issues fade away. Instead
          of protecting with fear, let's protect with fun.
        </p>

        <p class="lead">
          Then in RubyConfArgentina 2012 I have the luck to share good times
          with amazing people around music and fun. And then after spending
          hours talking about a Ruby Band I feel I needed to do something... but
          what?.
