          It's not about the "who" it's about the "when". IRB will not be a
          fixed band, everyone can take part. Just tell us when, give us the
          info and we'll broadcast it here.
        </p>

        <p class="lead">
          Forget about brand, forget about labels. We need to remember as a
          community to be together, to remember that every move will affect the
          harmony of the whole.
          It's about sharing, it's about community, it's about the message.
